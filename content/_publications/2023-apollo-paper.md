## Abstract

This paper presents Apollo, a flexible personal website generator that simplifies the process of creating and maintaining personal academic websites. We describe the architecture of Apollo, which separates content from presentation and allows for easy customization. We evaluate Apollo through user studies and find that it significantly reduces the time and effort required to create and maintain a personal website compared to traditional approaches.
