## Introduction

Understanding how large language models work internally is crucial for building safe and reliable AI systems. This work introduces new interpretability methods that provide insights into model behavior.

## Methods

Our approach combines several techniques:

1. **Activation analysis**: Systematic study of neural activations
2. **Attention visualization**: Understanding attention patterns
3. **Intervention studies**: Controlled modifications to model behavior

## Results

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on several benchmark tasks, showing improved interpretability without sacrificing performance.

## Conclusion

These interpretability methods represent a significant step forward in understanding large language models and contribute to the broader goal of AI safety.
