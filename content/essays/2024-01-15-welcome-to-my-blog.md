Welcome to my personal website! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, research, and insights on various topics that interest me.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into several sections:

- **Essays**: Longer-form writing on topics I'm passionate about  
- **Research**: Academic papers and publications
- **Interviews**: Conversations and talks I've participated in

## The Design

I've kept the design minimal and focused on readability, drawing inspiration from clean, typography-focused sites. The site supports both light and dark modes - try clicking the theme toggle in the header!

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the different sections and subscribe for updates on new posts. I hope you find something interesting here.

Thanks for visiting!
